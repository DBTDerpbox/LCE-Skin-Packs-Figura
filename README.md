# Minecraft LCE Skin Packs for Figura
Some of the skin packs from Minecraft Legacy Edition ported to [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura)

# Project is currently on hiatus
This project is currently on hiatus, and it will be a while before i get around to finishing it as i'm quite busy with many things, but feel free to fork it and add more skins!

## Installation

You will need to install [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use/), [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) to use any custom models the skins may have.

Once you have done that, log into a world, pause the game and open the figura menu (Blue Triangle) and select `Open Models Folder`

You may then copy/move the skins you would like to use into this folder.

Once you have selected the skin you would like to use, click on the Upload button to make the changes visible to other Figura users!
