# MCLE-Skin-Packs-Figura
All of the skin packs from Minecraft Legacy Edition ported to [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura)

## "Full" models?

Full models contain the entire player model for quick swapping in-game instead of having to upload the texture to mojang's servers and relog, but will only be visible to other Figura users. a non-full model will show the skin to non-figura users when set up properly, but only figura users will see the custom model for that skin.

Some models will not have a Full variant, this just means the skin either works fine without needing any custom model, or uses a completely custom model that can't be used with Mojang's skin servers.
