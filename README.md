# MCLE Skin Packs Figura
All of the skin packs from Minecraft Legacy Edition ported to [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura)

## Installation

You will need to install [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use/), [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) and [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) to use any custom models the skins may have.

Once you have done that, log into a world, and open the figura menu (Blue Triangle) and select `Open Models Folder`

You may then copy/move the skins you would like to use into this folder. **Warning!** Figura currently does not have support for multiple folders, so make sure you put the skin folders in the root of the `model_files` folder, or else they wont load!

I highly reconmend going to the `Trust Menu` and enabling `Vanilla Avatar Changes` for untrusted users for some models from this pack to render properly if another player is using them!

Once you have selected the skin you would like to use, click on the Upload button to make the changes visible to other Figura users!

## "Full" models?

Full models contain the entire player model for quick swapping in-game instead of having to upload the texture to mojang's servers and relog, but will only be visible to other Figura users. a non-full model will show the skin to non-figura users when set up properly, but only figura users will see the custom model for that skin.

Some models will not have a Full variant, this just means the skin either works fine without needing any custom model, or uses a completely custom model that can't be used with Mojang's skin servers.
